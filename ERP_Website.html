    <h2 style="color:#069">Business Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Kostal Dive Travel and Tours is a boat renting and Island Hopping business where water sports enthusiasts and partygoers may rent the equipment and services offered by the business so they may enjoy and wind-off on their oceanic travels. The services and paraphernalia offered by the business mainly extend to Scuba Diving and Island Hopping.
      </p>
      <h2 style="color:#069">Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      This final project for Kostal Dive Travel & Tours builds upon a previously implemented system for voucher and permit creation, expanding into broader operational support through ERP. The ERP system developed focuses on three main modules: <strong>Customer Data Management</strong>, <strong>Boat Trip Scheduling</strong>, and <strong>Internal Communication</strong> between employees, coordinators, and the owner. The ERP system was developed to enhance operational efficiency and reduce reliance on manual processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ERP brochure provided below outlines the purpose and design of the solution, highlighting key features such as centralized customer records, real-time trip scheduling, and integrated team chat. These features align closely with the business’s current needs and were selected to ensure minimal disruption to existing financial processes, which remain separate.
    </p>
      <h2 style="color:#069"> Chosen ERP</h2>
      <p>
          Odoo is a modular open-source ERP system designed to streamline business operations. For Kostal Dive Travel & Tours, Odoo fits perfectly by replacing our manual processes of cross-referencing and retrieval of old customer data with  digitized records and real-time data access.

      <h2 style="color:#069">Why Odoo?</h2>

    <p>
      Allows all employees and coordinators to easily and freely communicate in real-time. Supports teamwork and communication between employees and prevents confusion when working together in bookings.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:#069">Benefits and Goals Aligned</h2>
    <p>
      The ERP system developed for Kostal Dive Travel & Tours directly aligns with the original project goals of improving operational efficiency, reducing manual errors, and enhancing coordination. By centralizing customer data, digitizing boat trip scheduling, and enabling real-time internal communication, the system streamlines essential business processes without disrupting existing workflows. It eliminates the need for scattered spreadsheets and messaging apps, replacing them with a unified interface that supports staff coordination and decision-making. The solution is scalable, user-friendly, and tailored to the company's workflow, ensuring it meets current operational demands while supporting future growth.
